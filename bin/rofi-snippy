# Author: Lorenzo Gaggini
# Version: 1.0
#
# Based on "snippy" by "sessy", ehanced by mhwombat 
# (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=71938)
#
# This version may be more convenient for people who only need 
# one-line snippets, because all your snippets can go in one file.
#
# You will also need "rofi", "xsel" and "xdotool". Get them from your linux
# distro in the usual way.
#
# To use:
# 1. Create a file in your home directory called ".snippyrc".
#
# 2. The format of the file is shown below:
#
#        [tag] text_to_paste
#
#    Where "[tag]" starts in column 1. For example:
#
#        [hw] Hello, world!
#
# 3. Bind a convenient key combination to this script.
#
#    TIP: If you're using AwesomeWm, add something like this rc.lua
#    awful.key({ modkey, "Shift" },"s", function () awful.util.spawn_with_shell("rofi-snippy") end), --  [s]nippets
#

CONFIG=${HOME}/.snippyrc
ROFI_ARGS=""

# Display the menu and get the selection
SELECTION=$(/usr/bin/rofi -dmenu "${ROFI_ARGS}" < "${CONFIG}")

# Get the text associated with the selection.
TEXT=$(grep -F "${SELECTION/\] */]}" "${CONFIG}" | sed "s/^\[[^]]*\] //")

if [ "${TEXT}" ]; then
  # Put the selected string (without the trailing newline) into the primary and clipboard buffer
  echo -n "${TEXT}" | xsel --input
  echo -n "${TEXT}" | xsel --input --clipboard
  # Paste into the current application.
  xdotool key shift+Insert
